# SampleID
A visual 'ID' created for the purpose of practicing AJAX using vanilla JavaScript. It stores celebrity data within a JSON file and uses AJAX to load it asynchronously.

To use this application, you need some type of web server downloaded. I recommend downloading xampp at https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html.
